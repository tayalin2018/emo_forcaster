      "post": "SSRI\u2019s for social anxiety\nHas anyone tried SSRI\u2019s or other medication for social anxiety or OCD Becuase I feel like I\u2019ve literally nearly tried everything and I still feel so inhibited and insecure and off I just want something to work so it\u2019s kind of a last resort kind of thing. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s very much to do with the chemicals in my brain at this point and I\u2019m getting really disheartened I just want to feel connection.   Everyone else around me insists that I seem fine just a bit shy. I\u2019ve been shy my entire life and I\u2019m sick of it I\u2019m getting too old for this lool. When I socialise one on one I feel it\u2019s worse as I put more pressure on myself; I stop myself from forming real connections and making friends Becuase I\u2019m scared of being rejected and not being interesting / good enough. This entire year I\u2019ve dedicated to building my confidence but there\u2019s just something missing and I feel I should try medication. There\u2019s just a barrier between me and the rest of the world I think lol...a thin one but it exists. I\u2019m just too self conscious and I care too much. I feel like I can\u2019t breath in social situations but I still force myself into them Becuase I know that\u2019ll help with the fear but there\u2019s something missing! Also I speak really softly and it bugs me   If it has helped anyone please let me know or if you\u2019ve found anything else that would work.   Thanks :)",
      "Post Summary": "This post reflects two distinct self-states:\r\n\r\nThe adaptive self-state revolves around her desire to manage her social anxiety and seek effective solutions. There is a sense of hopefulness in her efforts to explore options, such as SSRIs, and evidence of self-care in her decision to force herself into social situations, recognizing that this could be beneficial.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the maladaptive self-state is dominated by anxiety, characterized by self-criticism regarding herself and her fear of forming connections. This leads to avoidance behaviors driven by her anxiety.",

My \u2018customer service personality\u2019 and politeness translates into how I am with coworkers etc. It\u2019s so frustrating I feel unable to be myself.

If I don\u2019t know someone well enough (like super well) I\u2019m really inhibited and polite and like oooh sorry ooh. It\u2019s so annoying bc no one likes that. I\u2019m not a suck up at all, just elements of people pleasing (although I couldn\u2019t care less if they liked me???) I also find it hard to make real friends Becuase I have such a barrier of like politeness I can\u2019t show me true self and connect. People like me, but they don\u2019t know me. :(  I used to think I had like an inferiority complex type thing? I was scared of authority actively as a child, I wouldn\u2019t talk to my teachers (ages like 4-8).

      "post": "Why am I so \u2018picky\u2019? What\u2019s my problem?\nI\u2019m a 19yo INFP female. I\u2019ve spent this year trying to figure myself and my life out. I cut off all my shitty friends last year and have been pretty much alone ever since. I\u2019m very shy and socially anxious (always been shy) so i find hard it to socialise and make friends.   I had a solid group of girl friends from about 7 - 14. We were all super close and there were about 7/8 of us. I cut them off at 14 bc of typical girl drama and they were actively leaving out one of the girls I was close to.   Since then I just hung out with my best, closest friend (the one previously being left out) and it was just us and we did everything together. Around like 15 when we all had exams and stuff she went kind off hermit mode on me (and everyone else) and we stopped meeting / talking as much and started focusing solely on school. So that got kind of lonely!!   About a year and a half later when my friend was still kind of hermit mode I \u2018joined\u2019 this other group of friends. They weren\u2019t really \u2018my type\u2019 of people and it was sort of just superficial for all involved for the most part. I was looking through some old messages today (my memory is atrocious) and I realised how much I truly hated hanging out with them. I felt so out of place but I was so lonely and felt like I had no other option. We basically just did drugs and drank together so I could tolerate it for the most part. But they all seemed to get along sober too? I felt too shy and awkward to meet them when I was sober ???? What was wrong with me? Why couldn\u2019t I just get along with these people like they did each other???   Basically fast forward a few years and I\u2019ve never really been able to form another connection that I deem \u2018adequate\u2019 or \u2018deep\u2019 enough to consider a friend, since the breakdown of the original friendship group and then my best friend. A true friend. Am I too picky or is something wrong with me? I\u2019ve had people call me their friend, and I don\u2019t really feel the same. I\u2019m so confused. Looking back and realising how much I felt I didn\u2019t fit in with that group I was with for nearly two years really hit me. How much of a bitter loner I was, I used to say their humour didn\u2019t fit mine, their values etc. How do you look past the differences and connect regardless?   I stopped being friends with them because my mental health got so bad, I thought everyone hated me.   Can someone please help me. I\u2019m terrified that I\u2019ll be this way forever. Sorry this isn\u2019t that coherent. What if I never connect with anyone again? Why don\u2019t I deem any relationship or person \u2018good enough\u2019 to pursue?",

      "post": "Zero hour contract \u2018notice period\u2019?\nHi guys.   I\u2019ve been having some problems at work that have led to me wanting to quit outright. I work zero hour contract and usually 2 days a week, therefore a notice period isn\u2019t required but I have been told that two weeks is \u2018ideal\u2019. I really do not want to work this as it is 1. Not required and secondly because of the circumstances in which I have decided to leave.   How do I make this clear in my resignation letter? I am very nervous about this as I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be expected to and I find it hard to say no. I really want to stand up for myself and say no because the entire reason I\u2019m leaving is so I can start valuing myself, my skills and my time. What\u2019s the common etiquette for resignation letters/ how do I say I won\u2019t be working my \u2018notice\u2019 and how do I avoid the awkwardness of being questioned about it?   Thanks guys",

      "post": "Is it normal to lay in bed all day\nOver the past four years I have been quite depressed. Lately I feel slightly better though, lately as in the past week. I can get very depressed and suicidal and spend days and weeks in bed rotting. Occasionally I can come out of that funk tho. I don\u2019t consider myself that depressed....just hormonal...? And fed up with life.   But anyway, I tend to spend random days in bed when I have not much to do. Today I\u2019ve been sleeping on and off all day and eaten like crap. I peeled myself off the bed 30 mins ago and I feel awful. Is this ok though? I don\u2019t know how to stop? I consider myself lazy ???? Like I don\u2019t have any hobbies, I\u2019m not sure what else I\u2019d do? I think I\u2019m vitamin d deficient.   Any feedback or insight would be appreciated. Thanks everyone",
      "Post Summary": "One adaptive self-state involves seeking help from others and occasionally perceiving herself as capable of breaking free from depression. She doesn't fully consider herself depressed and speculates that it might be hormonal, which reflects some self-compassion. This state is driven by a desire to improve and a belief in her ability to do so, as seen in her statement that the past week was better in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe maladaptive self-state revolves around avoidance and neglect, such as spending days lying in bed. She is self-critical, viewing herself as lazy and lacking hobbies. These behaviors are linked to the depression she experiences.",

The elements within the adaptive self-state show considerable similarity, both within individual posts and across them."

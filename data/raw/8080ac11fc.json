      "post": "I am uncomfortable all the time but I keep pushing\nI am 25 years old, and I am just now starting to come to terms with the fact that I have been manipulated and controlled by my parents for my entire life. I\u2019ve always been a person who yearned for independence. I started working as soon as I was able to and I pushed myself so hard in college because I wanted to get a good career and support myself. Despite all that, I still live at home with them because they have convinced me that I am not ready. They have said things like, \u201cwhat if you lose all your money and then you just have to come back anyway?\u201d And honestly that thought terrifies me. My fathers also has access to my bank account and things like that. I\u2019ve been talking to my therapist about this for quite a while, and at one point she mentioned Complex PTSD, and I asked what would I even have PTSD from, and she said \u201cfrom years of emotional abuse.\u201d And I think that\u2019s when it all really hit me. Now when I look back I see all the mind games that were played, all the ways they exerted their control and made it seem so that I couldn\u2019t survive without them. Well, now I\u2019m finally making an exit plan. It\u2019s going to take a lot of careful, meticulous planning but I know it needs to be done. I am terrified to my core. I am shaking and just plain uncomfortable all. the. time. Not only am I finally pulling away from what seems to be a controlling, emotional abusive environment, but I am also doing this all on my own. I am watching my entire reality shift before my eyes in a way. In my culture, it\u2019s always \u201cfamily is everything.\u201d Not this time I guess.",

In this state, she engages in self-caring behaviors such as attending college, working, seeking therapy, and discussing plans to eventually leave home.\r\n\r\nMaladaptive self-state: This state is shaped by her belief that her parents hinder her autonomy and control her, leading her to perceive herself as unready to leave home.

      "post": "Someone noticed me\nOkay, this whole post is probably going to make me sound like my life is just sad but I need to get it off my chest anyway lol. So, I am a woman in my mid 20s. To make this part of the story short: I\u2019ve been through some traumatic and abusive situations, and so lately I\u2019ve just been going to therapy and working through everything so dating has been on the back burner for me. I also wanted to work on building my self esteem before I got back into dating because I always felt like, even though my friends and loved ones tell me I\u2019m beautiful and sweet and everything, it always seemed like guys never noticed me. Only the guys that wanted one specific thing seemed to notice me and for a while that bothered me, so I stopped focusing on it and started focusing just on rebuilding myself. Anyway, on my way to work this morning, I stopped in the cafeteria to grab something for breakfast. As I walked in, there were three men who I could tell by their uniforms worked in a different section of the building. One of them said \u201cgood morning\u201d to me and I said it back, not thinking anything of it. And then, as I looked at the baked goods trying to pick one, the same guy came over, pointed at one, and said that that one was the best, so I laughed and agreed to try it. And he said that I would need to come down again at lunch to tell him how it was. It was such a simple interaction but I couldn\u2019t help but smile all the way to my office because guys don\u2019t normally talk to me/notice me like that. It feels nice to be noticed :)",

This is evident when she mentions feeling noticed by someone and when her friends and loved ones tell her she is beautiful. It is accompanied by a desire for self-competence, as reflected in her efforts to build her self-esteem. When she feels acknowledged and her self-esteem is restored, she experiences happiness. Additionally, she engages in self-care behaviors, such as attending therapy to address her challenges.\r\n\r\nMaladaptive self-state: This smaller state is marked by self-criticism, as she describes her life as seeming sad. She also perceives past interactions with certain men, whom she felt only wanted things from her, as unfair and punitive.",

      "post": "Shoutout to the girl who befriended me because my ex annoyed her just as much as he annoyed me\nSo with the decade ending, I have been feeling a lot of nostalgia. At one point, I decided to go into my Facebook messages and scroll all the way back to the beginning. I\u2019m honestly not sure why I had that idea, but I did find some really interesting things that I had completely forgotten about, and it was such a cool walk down memory lane.   One conversation I found though was just wonderful and hilarious. And again, one that I completely forgot about.   Basically, my ex was not only a hothead but he was also pretty racist, sexist, transphobic, etc. (I know these words are thrown around a lot, but seriously. This guy liked to attack anyone and everyone.) I was blind to it because I was \u201cin love\u201d but eventually we broke up and it honestly just got worst because he didn\u2019t have me filtering him.   So like most of these people, his pedestal of choice was his Facebook page. One day, he posted something offensive (as usual) and it seems that I decided to comment something calling him out, but I don\u2019t remember specifically, and we got into it over the comments.   Anyway, a girl messaged me- specifically his friend\u2019s sister- a literal paragraph in which she thanked me for calling him out because she was so sick of his terrible posts. I said thank you and told her that I was actually his ex girlfriend, so I was pretty used to these things, and she immediately went off about how rude and temperamental he always was.   Long story short, for a few weeks after that, she would message me about the other annoying people from her school, she would ask me if college was better and how, and she would send me offensive posts from those other annoying people to ask me if she was wrong to be annoyed by it.   I always said \u201cno\u201d! Not just because they were indeed offensive in my opinion, but also because she\u2019s entitled to her beliefs.   We never became best friends or anything, but for some reason discovering those messages made me so nostalgic and weirdly happy.   With the holiday anxiety, I often forget about all the good things and all the people I have met, but connections happen all the time, in all kinds of ways!   PS - Sorry if the title is clickbaitish; I honestly wasn\u2019t sure how else to condense this",

Where I live, everything is very expensive. With my savings and current job I could afford something on the cheaper side, but all the places I\u2019ve reached out to either want you to be making 3 times the rent (which I\u2019m not) and show steady income for the last 6 months (which I can\u2019t because I just got a new job).   I know people always say a roommate is the easiest way to go, but I don\u2019t know anyone who is able to afford moving out of their current situation at the moment, and I really don\u2019t want to move in with a stranger.   I\u2019m trying so hard to find something because I need to get out of my situation. I don\u2019t want to end up with a crazy stranger and get into an even worse situation.   On that note, does anyone know of a way to find real, affordable housing? It seems when I search around the only affordable ones are 55+ only. Everything else is very expensive. If anyone knows a better way to search or any assistance programs or whatever else, I\u2019d really appreciate any input.",
      "Post Summary": "This post reveals two distinct self-states:\r\n\r\nAdaptive self-state: This state is characterized by her desire to improve her situation, reflected in her motivation to succeed in finding an apartment. It is accompanied by self-care behaviors and a perception that others are supportive and may be able to assist her.\r\n\r\nMaladaptive self-state: This state is marked by fear of failure, as she has already done some searching and found the process very challenging, leading to concerns that her competence needs may not be met. Additionally, her reluctance to be recognized suggests she perceives some people as detached or critical of her.",

  "timeline_summary": "The self-states fluctuate between adaptive and maladaptive, although the adaptive voice tends to be more moderate to dominant. She expresses a desire to improve herself, and it is implicitly clear that she believes success is possible, making her efforts worthwhile. Alongside this adaptive self-state, there is also a maladaptive state of hopelessness regarding the topics she discusses. These two self-states often coexist throughout her posts."

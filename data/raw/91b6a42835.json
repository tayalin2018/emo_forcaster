      "post": "Trying one more time to get through FFXIII, and I just have a few questions.\nIs it ever going to be explained why a demigod would do something as stupid as enslaving some humans to do its bidding and then not actually tell them what to do? I feel like there's something I'm supposed to know here, as none of the characters seem as bewildered about this whole thing as I am. Is the fal'Cie actually expecting to get anything done by making such shitty contracts? Are the eidolons aligned with the fal'Cie? And if they come to l'Cie in their greatest time of need, why does the l'Cie then have to prove themselves to it?  I would just like this whole area of the plot to make more sense. Pawns should have some semblance of an incentive to do what they're told as well as some kind of direction if their masters have any desire to get anything accomplished, but l'Cie seem to be in such a hopeless arrangement that they may as well immediately kill themselves.",

      "post": "I (M28) am right up to the point of breaking up with her (F26) after 11 months. I'm afraid I'll back out and continue to be unhappy.\nTL:DR; I'm afraid to break up and hurt her, but I'm also afraid I'll let us go on being unhappy.  I don't even really know how to go about this. We basically live together for how much of her stuff she has at my apartment, which is a first in relationships for me. But more than just simple logistics, I don't want to hurt her and I know this would devastate her. I feel weak for how much I don't want to see her cry, but I can't be cold and do anything other than have a thorough talk about it.  I've realized that there's no undermining the happiness that we have had, that the great times will always have been great and it will simply be hard to give up on the chance for more of them together. I've realized that it just isn't worth being unhappy more than we're happy.  This just sucks, I wish it was over with, and I'll need to be thinking of every supportive thing anyone has said to me about this while she probably proceeds to punish the both of us over the decision.  This is something I know is best for both of us, but I'm just so afraid to pull the trigger and I feel pathetic for it. The last thing I want to do is hurt her, but staying together is slowly hurting us both.  Any kind words to help me go through with what I feel I need to do, or any advice for someone new to this on how to execute a breakup when our daily lives and possessions have become so integrated, would be terrific.  Thank you very much.",
      "Post Summary": "This post reflects two self-states, one adaptive and one maladaptive.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive self-state centers on the desire for autonomy in addressing the unhappy relationship. He experiences adaptive grief over the good aspects of the relationship that he now wishes to let go of. His behavior reflects consideration for his partner, as he does not want to hurt them, and he seeks help and advice from others.\r\n\r\nThe maladaptive self-state revolves around anxiety and the expectation that his partner will be hurt by the breakup and may retaliate against his decision. He is self-critical and perceives himself as weak.",

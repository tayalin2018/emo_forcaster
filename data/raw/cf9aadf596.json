      "Post Summary": "A maladaptive self-state is evident and dominant in this post. The writer expresses feelings of depression, with hopelessness and suicidal thoughts recurring throughout. They also demonstrate a highly critical perspective of both themselves and others.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mention of having friends suggests that they perceive themselves as capable of forming connections and recognize others as relatable. Additionally, their apology at the end of the post indicates an element of relational behavior toward others.",

I asked her out 2 weeks after that, she said she wasn't over her ex which was my best friend ( yeah, leftovers what the fuck is it to you?). He CONSTANTLY ridiculed me for it. Then today, I had a complete mental breakdown with crying, suicidal thoughts, and posts to/r/suicidewatch . I took a nap, and then I woke up and felt the best I've ever felt I. the Past 4 months. I texted her,i and she told me that she can't go to homecoming with me because it would be \"awkward\". Fucking hilarious right? Like this is all some ducking elaborate prank where every girl who says she's interested in me, FUCKING goes back and fucks me over. Everything is going the exact opposite to plan! Hilarious, right? I just want to FUCKING laugh to my grave.",
      "Post Summary": "There is a dominant maladaptive self-state focused on the perception that others are detached from him\u2014whether it's a friend who ridicules him or the girl he asks to homecoming. Additionally, there is a subtle sense of self-criticism when things do not go according to his plans, which contributes to manic episodes, breakdowns, and thoughts of self-harm, along with avoidance behaviors as a means of dissociation.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive element evident in the post is his perception of himself as capable of connecting with others, as shown when he asks the girl to homecoming.",

      "post": "[HELP!] Calling All Animal Fosters from around the Orange County area!\nI am in desperate need of some help right now.      I have recently found a bundle of 7 or so kittens hanging around a dangerous abandoned lot with ages ranging from 2 to 7 months.   Since finding them, I have started to feed and water them in the hopes that one of them will trust me enough to get close to me. My initial plan was TNR but, due to the fact that they're young, I want them to have a better future in a home with a loving family.      I unfortunately cannot be that person since the place I live in right now does not allow animals and I am not staying in California forever. I've tried contacting different TNR and foster programs for some help or assistance during the matter but most places are already full or have too many projects to take care of.  I'm a poor college girl but I want to try my best to get these cats a better life out of that lot...  Would anyone be willing to help me or give me some advice on what to do? I'm desperate.",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self-state in the post is an adaptive one, centered on the desire to help the kittens secure a better future by addressing their needs. This is accompanied by her perception of herself actively supporting them and engaging in helpful behaviors. Additionally, she expresses hope that someone or an organization will step in to assist.\r\n\r\nThe maladaptive self-state, however, is reflected in her expression of desperation and heightened tension about the situation, emphasizing her urgent need for help.",

I have nothing ahead of me. I have one more year left of college and then what? Struggling financially until the world caves in on itself?  Will everyone I meet just be manipulative attention seekers and only take advantage of the kindness or interest I've showed them?   I have nothing to look forward to; I have no opportunities in business and in love. Why do I even try.  Maybe I'm better off living alone.",

She perceives others as manipulative and exploiting her kindness.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the subtle adaptive self-state involves trusting the doctors\u2019 honesty about the effects of the pills, showing self-compassion, and viewing herself as kind and genuinely interested in others.",

On the other hand, she sometimes views people as manipulative and exploitative, feeling taken advantage of."

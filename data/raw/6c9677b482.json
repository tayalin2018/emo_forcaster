      "post": "[Rant] I have trouble leaving the house. When I do, people assume I am something that I hate.\nSo, for some backstory - I've had depression, avoidance and anxiety for about 12 years now. It completely ruined my life; I dropped out of education, I'm unable to work, I have 0 friends in real life and human interaction terrifies or even disgusts me. Being in a crowded place could make me cry. I would stay in my flat for months, just getting groceries every now and then, rarely ever cleaning up after myself and sinking into the internet for distraction, so I wouldn't have to feel anything.   The last year has been the first that I actually felt like I'm getting better. I'm being treated medically and with therapy, I am no longer completely lonely and I have been making efforts to do things, even ones I don't like. I have been leaving the house.   However, I moved. I got into a really bad place for the first few months and shelled in again, but now I got used to my new temporary home and environment. However, going out is much, much harder.  I'm in Israel right now, so I stand out a bit as a pale, tall northern european girl. People stare at me. There have been cases when they actually made remarks about how pale I am, that I look like a freak and a snob. But that's not the worst part.  Whenever I go to a new restaurant or other place where you are catered to by other people, they assume that I'm russian. Now, that might not seem like a big deal, as they don't mean any harm - they see an european looking person and assume that. But it fills me with burning anger and self-disgust.  Russians have killed, raped and mentally scarred people from my country for decades. Several members of my family were killed by them. The same applies to many other european countries and this amount of ignorance is appalling. Our ancestors, language and alphabet, religion and folklore are completely different. I have no russians in my bloodline. There is literally no connection between us other than war, blood and perhaps commerce. Unless you hear a person speaking russian, you shouldn't assume they are and I hate that it's happening to me.   Today, I asked for an English menu. I was instantly asked \"Russian?\" \"no...english\" \"oh, I just assumed, because you know...*waves towards my face*\" in that moment I felt so ashamed, dirty and angry. I wanted to smash my face until it was something else. I wanted to burrow myself into the ground. I wanted to blurt out \"I wonder how you would feel if everyone assumed you were palestinian\" but I just kept quiet with my distilled anger and shame. It wasn't their fault and I shouldn't insult them.  I don't know how to deal with this. I hate this so much. I don't want to deal with this ever again but the fact I have to force myself out means I will have to. Fuck this.",
      "Post Summary": "The main self state in the post is maladaptive, and centers around her expectation that her relatedness needs will not be met, expecting others to devaluate thus upsetting her in social interactions. these interactions terrify her, and she even feels disgusted by others people. she views others as detached, sharing that they make tactless remarks on her appearance. these situations make her feel angry and shamed, leading her to view her look in a self critical way, stating she wished she look differently. this leads to her neglecting herself, and staying at home. the adaptive self state is centered around the desire to get better in regards to her social anxiety and depression, leading her to seek treatment showing self car behavior. she views herself compassionately sometimes, and sees an improvement following this behavior. it makes her feel hopeful.",

He's halfway across the globe so there's no way for me to physically meet him.  What should I do? What would you like to be done to you, to consider not dying in such a situation?

Add oil to the pan and brown the beef. Put it aside. 1. Add onion + garlic into the same pan and fry until golden 1. Put the onion, pearl barley, beef and 2l stock into a large pot (at least 3,5l capacity) 1. Keep pot on high heat/open until it boils. Then switch to low heat and cover. Cook for 45 min. 1. Add carrots, leek, potato and 0,7l stock. Cook for 15 min or until the vegetables are soft. 1. Add thyme, oregano and salt&amp;pepper. You can skip the salt&amp;pepper if you used bullion cubes. :)  Enjoy!   *[edit] forgot to include serving size.*",

The reason I got in this situation was moving countries, and my prescriptions not being valid where I was until I went through some bureaucracy with my psychiatrist. I went to schedule the meeting and the earliest they gave me was the 27th.  So, after spending a week worrying about this, I actually went out to the office again and explained my situation. They gave me an earlier date immediately. Why didn't I do it the first time? I was too scared to open my mount and ask for a different date. It sounds completely ridiculous but I physically couldn't do it.  Thanks to those of you that told me not to give up and gave me tips on my original post. I probably wouldn't have made myself go out if it wasn't for thinking over your posts.",

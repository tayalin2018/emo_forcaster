What's the point of you cant have love? How do I break free from that. I feel other people with chronic illness deserve love. Why shouldnt I? I dont know how to cope. Getting closer to the dark thoughts and planning. I have attempted in the past a few times due to this issue too. I need help and I dont want to admit myself because the hospital here is going downhill and last time they refused to give me medication I needed and almost killed me and wouldnt give me it till my parents spoke up. I cant go somewhere where they wont even try to listen to the patients. Urs dangerous there for me and scary. I dont really know what I need. Maybe just to vent this. I just feel unworthy of life and love. And it's getting harder and harder to cope.",
      "Post Summary": "The main self state in this post is centered around her expectation that her relatedness needs will not be met, and her cognition of herself as unlovable and worthless because of her chronic illness. This expectation leads her to feel very depressed and fills her with despair. She behaves in ways that harm her because she is not taking care of herself although she is in severe distress, feeling herself getting closer to self-harm behavior, because she views others (the hospital staff) as unhelpful. The second self state in this post is adaptive, and is comprised of her wish to feel loved, and feeling worthy of love although she is chronically ill.",

      "post": "26 USA Someone who can help motivate me to exercise everyday and avoid binging.\nI have a heart issue where I have low blood pressure (it does not rise with activity either) and high heart rate. I need to exercise everyday (light exercise like walking) in order to help build strength and energy levels. When i miss a day, it is hard for me to get out of bed the next day, so it's very important for my health.   I'm not overweight, but I do binge at night sometimes and would like someone who could be a support to help me avoid that. When I eat a lot of carbs/calories at a time, it makes my heart worse it feels like. I get more dizzy and a higher heart rate. So, I need to avoid that but sometimes my apathy with depression overcome me and I'm like \"fuck it\" and do it anyways. So someone to talk to in those times could help.   I usually start to binge around 10-11pm. If there is anyone who could assist me with motivation for my health, I would love that! We could encourage each other!",

She is seeking help from others and feels hopeful about getting better with the help of others, and behaves in ways that help promote her self-care. The other self state is a maladaptive one, where she feels depressed and that feeling leads her to behave in a harmful manner towards herself by binge eating. The feelings of depression make her feel hopeless expect she will not get better, leading to the self-harm behavior of binge eating.",

Then he tells me he likes me a lot. THEN goes on a date with a girl. Second date with her, sleeps over. Texts me WHILE STILL WITH HER. Super shutty imo. Tells me THE NEXT DAY he loves and would \"ideally want a long distance thing with me\". Has another date with this girl. Said he was gonna tell her about me. Things are weird. Take a break talking. Talk again after a couple days then sext. NEXT DAY nothing from him. He says it brought up bad emotions from trauma. Cool fine. I respect that as I have PTSD. I need a break from him again cus yeah. Decide to be friends. Cool. He is absolutely cold and distant. Never initiates a convo. I do it all. Then we finally talk after I'm having a breakdown and want to die. Found out he is dating that girl now. I am done. I cant be friends after all that. Date who you want, but I cant handle that. Just WHY.",

Sometimes the maladaptive self state is present by itself, but sometimes it is switching back and forth with the adaptive self state in one segment."

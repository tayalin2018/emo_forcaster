      "Post Summary": "The main self state in the post is maladaptive and is centered around the expectation that she will not be able to manage her food intake by herself, thus not fulfilling her competence needs. She feels desperate, as on one hand she criticizes herself when she eats claiming she binges, and then acts in a compensatory way and runs too much, self-harming herself. The adaptive self state is composed of the wish to receive help from others regarding her difficult struggle, and her relating behavior exhibited when asking for advice from others.",

      "Post Summary": "The main self state in the post is maladaptive and centers around her great suffering, which she perceives as something huge that she cannot heal, as exhibited in her reluctance to go to the hospital because it might not be worth it. this reluctance is a fight or flight response to her not wanting anyone to know about her situation, as she views others as detached. the situation is so dire that she sounds disconnected, blunted and apathetic towards her fate, leading to self-neglect in the form of dealing with her severe situation on her own. The adaptive self-state is composed of the cry for help from others, showing a desire to get help in the form of motivation/advice to go to the hospital. she knows if she doesn't ask anyone she will do nothing about it, hence she behaves in this relating way. she is exhibiting self-care behavior in the form of working and getting insurance from the job so she can take care of herself.",

Even the things you\u2019re supposed do daily takes too much energy to do. I hope you can stop prioritizing school but me instead for a little while so I can heal. My thoughts are not silly or a teenage phase either and taking antidepressants won\u2019t cure everything immediately. I know you guys keep telling me other people have it worse than me but I can\u2019t help feeling like this. You made me promise you that I would go to school tomorrow but I honestly don\u2019t think I can. I\u2019m too scared to and thought of it makes me want to die.

The dominant self-state is marked by a depressed affect, with his parents perceived as unattuned to his needs by making him to go to school, which he finds unbearable. He expresses fear, which intensifies his desire to die, and has a negative self-cognition, viewing himself as a disappointment.",

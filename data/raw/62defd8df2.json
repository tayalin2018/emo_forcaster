      "post": "Feeling as if I go cross eyed?\nI have OCD &amp; anxiety and usually when talking to people (which often makes me subconsciously stressed/uncomfortable due to intrusive thoughts and overthinking) I get this feeling that my eyes are crossing?   *Apparently* they aren\u2019t according to other people. When it\u2019s bad I obsessively check it in my camera and take lots of photos just to make sure. does anyone else experience this? Is it my OCD tricking me again? Making me hyper aware of everything my body is doing? Or is it something else. I can\u2019t find anything on google about it.   Thank you in advance   /r/Anxiety /r/SocialAnxiety /r/ocd /r/MentalHealth",

      "post": "I\u2019m so lonely please help\nHello :)  I\u2019m so lonely all the time. The friends I did have I didn\u2019t consider quality friends and I cut them off when I noticed I wasn\u2019t being invited to things anymore. I have felt lonely deep in my soul for about four years now and I don\u2019t know how to shake it.   I feel depressed a lot and I believe it\u2019s the reason I have lost my sense of self. I also suffer from (social) anxiety and OCD (pure o). I cant make connections with people because I feel so empty, I don\u2019t trust my social skills or my personality to carry me. I feel like everything I do is fake (maybe partly due to the nature of my OCD). So it\u2019s not even like \u2018joining a club\u2019 would help me at this point. I need to work on myself first. But it\u2019s so hard with no one to talk to or do things with.   Everything feel so meaningless now. I look at everyone else making connections with people and at the very most I can do small talk. I am truly pathetic. My social anxiety mixed with OCD and depression feels crippling. I feel as though I\u2019m missing out on one of the best times in my life. I\u2019m on the outside looking in at everyone having fun and being capable. I know everyone likely suffers from some form of mental illness and is just putting on a brace face, but I feel it\u2019s so much easier when those people have good friends, plans, jobs, reasons to wake up.   Can anyone give me any advice / stories that will give me hope to continue.   Thank you :) /r/SocialAnxiety /r/depressed /r/Depression /r/help /r/MentalHealth /r/ocd /r/Advice",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self-state is maladaptive, characterized by feeling deeply lonely. This loneliness stems from self-criticism, where they view themselves as truly pathetic and perceive others as detached, especially when not invited. There is an expectation that their competence needs will not be met, and they lack trust in their ability to change the situation.\r\n\r\nThe other self-state, driven by the first, is more adaptive, focused on seeking self-care and the help of others. They recognize the need to work on themselves and are actively seeking advice.",

      "post": "I think there\u2019s something very wrong with me.\nHello reddit   Just a disclaimer before I write this. I have depression, anxiety, suspected OCD and social anxiety. :) I have not taken any meds for any of them.   But other than those...I just think there\u2019s something really wrong with my personality. I\u2019m writing this because I can\u2019t get it out of my head and I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any tips or feels the same. I can\u2019t stop thinking there\u2019s something just completely wrong with ME. which is part of the problem in itself I guess.    Up until this point in my life I\u2019ve always thought I\u2019ve just been shy. But now I\u2019m rethinking my entire life. What if I have NO IDEA how to socialise. I\u2019m afraid of being obnoxious or annoying or a burden so I don\u2019t really talk that much (no one has ever said I have before so I don\u2019t know where this has come from, but it\u2019s been since I was little) I keep my answers to things at a minimum. I just thought this is how I was with people I\u2019m not really close with (including my family) - id rather talk about them not me. But now im thinking what if I\u2019m so painfully awkward I have no idea how to elaborate, be enthusiastic (depression?) and have a full conversation. I can\u2019t tell stories!!! I stutter and I get nervous, even if it\u2019s a banging story. ( I think no one cares) is it low self esteem or am I socially inept? I can\u2019t trust myself. I want to be witty and funny and NOT awkward with everyone, but I seem so be so painfully reserved I have no idea how. It must just be ingrained in my personality.   In reality, in my rational, not mentally ill brain, i DONT CARE about being judged. I know people don\u2019t think about my mistakes or even notice them in the same way that I do. But it\u2019s something I cannot shake. And it\u2019s awful. There must be something up.   **i struggle in social situations:**i used to have friends up until recently. I cut them off (or rather we cut each other off as they haven\u2019t reached out since) because I couldn\u2019t get the idea that they hated me out my mind. Every time I met them I felt cripplingly insecure. I stopped being invited to things. We had been friends for about a year prior and I think at some point my brain just snapped? I hated my personality. I felt like everyone was laughing at me. But anyway, I\u2019ve always considered myself a shy person, but not totally socially inept. But now I\u2019m wondering if I am socially inept??? My brain goes blank sometimes, my heart beats fast and I can go red. I speak SO QUIETLY. I\u2019m so unsure of everything I say. I feel embarrassed when I talk. I\u2019m awkward. I listen to other people talk with ease and I\u2019m just in awe. How do they do that? I am good with eye contact but due to OCD (I\u2019ve been told) I am hyper aware of everything I\u2019m doing. I also get intrusive thoughts. Once I realise I\u2019m making eye contact I freak out, think I\u2019m going cross eyed or something. I feel utterly hopeless. I don\u2019t know how to make friends anymore. Did I ever? I\u2019m second guessing every single thing about my personality. I feel unlikable and unnoticeable.   I have a constant inner monologue, which is semi normal as far as I\u2019m aware - but every time I speak I think I overthink. It\u2019s less of a voice telling me everything I say is stupid but more of a feeling. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve lost all my social capabilities. I can\u2019t trust myself so how would I know? Apparently it\u2019s not as visible on the outside. I seek reassurance (ocd), not too much because it\u2019s really annoying lol but if I\u2019ve just interacted with someone and I\u2019m with my boyfriend, after that\u2019s over I\u2019ll ask him things like \u201cwas that ok? Did I sound weird? Did I look weird?\u201d. My family have joked that I have \u2018personality dysmorphia\u2019 lol. Is that even possible.   I\u2019m just really scared because I don\u2019t want to be socially inept. I\u2019m seeing something that others don\u2019t as well. I just want to socialise with ease. If I CAN get rid of the anxiety I just get worried about what I\u2019ll say and my mind goes blank. If in the moment I\u2019m ok, afterwards I\u2019ll overanalyse it.   It\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m not being myself because I don\u2019t know what myself is. I CANNOT trust myself. I just want to skip through the cracks. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll upset or hurt people if I talk to them too which is slightly irrational. I\u2019ll beat myself up for weird things I\u2019ve done and I\u2019ll remind myself I haven\u2019t even done or said that?????   Also sometimes I feel completely STUCK and unable to say something.

I\u2019ve done this for so long I also don\u2019t know what to say - I forget my day as soon as I live it. It\u2019s not like someone\u2019s like \u201cdid you have a good day\u201d and I\u2019m like blunt af like \u201cyep\u201d I\u2019m polite and all but why don\u2019t I ever expand when asked questions and I usually just turn it back on the other person and they have a lot to say. I feel like a diluted version of myself when I\u2019m not around like one close friend. Even family. Does anyone else do this? Why am I so afraid to talk about myself for longer than like a second. Low self esteem? Or is there something wrong with me?   I want to be able to talk about myself a bit more because that\u2019s how people get to know you. I\u2019m way too closed off? I can\u2019t even help it anymore I just think no one cares lol I feel like it gives off such a weird vibe especially if I have spoken to you more than once lol it\u2019s like I\u2019m hiding something or don\u2019t trust the person (or myself) enough to open up   What is this   /r/Socialskills /r/SocialAnxiety /r/ocd /r/TooAfraidToAsk",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self-state reflects the writer's difficulty expressing themselves and forming deeper connections in certain social situations. This is accompanied by self-criticism and flight behavior, as evidenced by avoiding answers and redirecting the conversation to others. This is followed by a belief that perhaps no one really cares, along with a tense and anxious affect about feeling \"weird.\"\r\n\r\nA more subtle self-state involves a desire for relatedness, as indicated by the writer's wish to be able to talk about themselves, recognizing that sharing personal thoughts is how people get to know each other.",

  "timeline_summary": "The self-states in this timeline appear more stable, with the maladaptive state being dominant. It gives voice to self-criticism and low self-beliefs, accompanied by feelings of loneliness, despair, and a depressed and anxious affect. These elements remain consistent throughout the timeline. The adaptive self-state is more subtle, but it can still be heard. It is characterized by a desire for relatedness and an effort to engage in self-care with the help and advice of others."

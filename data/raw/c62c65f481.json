      "post": "Is there any difference in how you treat the relationship as them being with a guy vs them being with a girl?\nMy best friend came out as a lesbian, and she has a girlfriend now! I was wondering if the boundaries are any different when it comes to two girls being together vs a guy and a girl.   I know clear boundaries! I try to think to myself: \u201cIf it were my partner, how would I feel?\u201d I would never have a sleepover with her girlfriend or undress in front of her etc.   My best friend encouraged me to befriend her girlfriend outside of her so I have been. It just feels like the line gets blurry when it comes to having a friend who is a girl. I don\u2019t want to disrespect my friend and sometimes I feel like there can be a lot more jealousy in their relationship compared to past ones she has had. There have been instances where my friend seems upset with me or has gotten upset with me for doing things that she has done with me and my past ex-partners. For example: saying raunchy jokes around your best friend\u2019s partner.   I\u2019m sorry if this is a stupid question, I just am new to gay dating and so is my friend! I am bisexual as well but I have never been with a girl as of yet so I have no idea when it comes to any of this.",

She appears to seek validation for her thoughts and actions, reflecting a belief that others can provide guidance or help. The writing style conveys energy, and the text reveals a sense of self-acceptance, as seen in her openness about her sexuality and friendships.\r\n\r\nAnother self-state is evident, marked by criticism of her friend, noting actions she claims she would never take in a similar situation. This perspective suggests underlying jealousy regarding her friend\u2019s new circumstances. Additionally, a subtle critical voice appears when she asks for forgiveness for her inquiries, hinting at some self-reproach.",

      "post": "Should I [24F] say something to my friend [21F] or just leave it alone?\nMy best friend Julia and I have been good friends for over two years or so. I was there for her during her coming out as a lesbian and every obstacle that came her way, and continually picked her side when my ex would try to be rude towards her or make me cut her off because he was threatened by her. She moved away to another city for a few months in the summertime.  Recently Julia started dating a girl named Alicia. At the time she was still living in a different city and Alicia lived here. Julia encouraged Alicia and I to be best friends too so I started hanging out with Alicia. At first it was hunky dory and I felt really good, I had two best friends that wanted to hangout or Julia would call all the time and it was a good friend group.   Until it wasn\u2019t. Julia ended up moving to our city and everything changed. Suddenly BOTH Julia and Alicia barely talk to me and barely want to hangout. Julia has expressed to me that she\u2019s going through depression so I tried to be forgiving of it and try to understand from a viewpoint of someone who also suffers from mental illness.   However it\u2019s reached a ridiculous point. I have to push for a response from her, and when I am with her she is weirdly passive aggressive towards me (for example: I threw her a huge surprise party and spent over $200 on her and she keeps going off about how I wouldn\u2019t let her do party drugs in my house) and when I talk about my problems she looks annoyed or uninterested. However she can call me crying or go off about her problems for long periods of time where I actively listen and give feedback. I will always do little favours for her and I feel unappreciated. (Example: I was driving her and Alicia to her car and she turned up the music in my car to shut me and her girlfriend up when we were talking. ) It feels like nothing I do is good enough for her.   I understand that there is a honeymoon and sometimes isolation stage with new relationships but I\u2019m not sure if that is the case or if it is depression. She only wants to spend time with her girlfriend. She expressed fears of losing her friends from being with her girlfriend too much but continues to stay distant from me and others. I sort of feel used by both of them and like I was a filler friend until they had each other.   I was wondering if I should ask her if I have done something to bother her to make her act this way or voice my feelings? Or if I should leave it alone?   TLDR: Best friend and I were really close. She moved away but started dating a girl in my city and encouraged us to be friends. As soon as she moved back, her and her girlfriend have barely associated with me. When I do see her, she is passive aggressive and has no interest in my life or problems but will go off about her own. She has expressed that she is depressed but being a supportive friend hasn\u2019t helped, and she is unappreciative when I do things for her. Unsure if she\u2019s stuck in honeymoon stage or just really stuck in her depression. Should ask her if I have done something to bother her to make her act this way or voice my feelings? Or should I leave it alone?",
      "Post Summary": "The first self-state is characterized by the writer\u2019s positive self-perception as a good friend and her sense of self-acceptance in this role. She demonstrates a relational behavior through her willingness to go out of her way for her friends. Despite experiencing emotional pain due to the way she is treated, she legitimizes and somewhat understands her friends' behavior. This self-state also reflects a sense of self-competence, evident in her ability to make friends and support others.\r\n\r\nThe second self-state, which is equally prominent in the text, reflects unmet relational needs. The writer expresses feeling used and perceives her friends as detached, self-focused, and inattentive to her struggles. This self-state is accompanied by feelings of a slight depressed hopelessness, as she feels unappreciated and overly controlled by her friends.",

      "post": "I feel used and like I was a filler person for my friend who also has BPD.\nI have this best friend who I\u2019ve been friends with for two years. In the beginning, she was everything you could dream of in a friend. She would genuinely care about hearing about me and my day, rush over if I was feeling sad or do little things like run and jump on me with a bunch of gifts for my birthday. We would sing songs together, hangout constantly, workout together and just be thicker than thieves.   Until she found a friend she liked better and potential love interest. Then she went to being cold and everything I did pissed her off. She would be passive aggressive and even aggressive towards me when we lived together. It was an absolute hell. She would be really mean to me and if I voiced my feelings then she would get mad about it.   And then things got better again when that person wasn\u2019t around, it genuinely felt like she was back to caring about me and my feelings. I kept thinking to myself that we could go back to the way things used to be. They never quite got back to the same but it was a start. I thought maybe it was because she was depressed and going through things.   Until she found her SO. Now she\u2019s constantly with her SO and if she does hangout with me then she acts disinterested or annoyed when I talk to her about my problems. Yet she will confide into me about her own and even said she \u201cweirdly is always fighting with her SO when she sees me.\u201d (Ouch, glad you can only find time for me when your SO is pissing you off or you need something). I have continually tried to make birthdays, Christmases and other holidays special for her and pouring my heart, soul and money into her to make things special and in return she focuses on the things I didn\u2019t do for her or things wouldn\u2019t allow her to do in my home. She sometimes makes snide comments about personal situations to me. When I do favours for her, she treats me with disregard. Even recently turning my music in my car up to shut me up when I\u2019m talking when doing her a favour by giving her a ride to her car after a night of drinking where I left her and her SO my liquor the night before. I can do no right with her.  It drives me fucking crazy that I am so bothered by someone who clearly doesn\u2019t feel an emotional connection to me or that I pathetically keep trying to appease her or show her that people do care about her because NOTHING I do is good enough. It doesn\u2019t feel like she cares about me or even cares to have me in her life.   I hate having her as an fp because whenever there\u2019s someone she considers better then she clings to them until it doesn\u2019t workout and THEN she suddenly cares about me. I know I need to stop and let it go and not get to me but it hurts. It hurts more than anything and I\u2019m tired of feeling like I will always come second best. I don\u2019t want her to be my fp and I hate that my shit brain won\u2019t let me detach. I\u2019m tired of hurting over someone who is probably not even giving me a second thought at this very moment.",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self-state reflects a tense emotional response to the situation with her friend. She feels her friend is detached and indifferent to her needs, leading to an expectation that these relational needs will remain unmet. She expresses that her friend lacks an emotional connection with her and that her efforts to support her friend are never enough. This self-state is also accompanied by self-criticism, as she describes herself as pathetic and overly eager to please.\r\n\r\nThe other self-state highlights the writer\u2019s role as a caring and supportive friend, striving to do what good friends should. She acknowledges knowing what she needs to do to improve her own well-being, demonstrating self-care. Additionally, she allows herself to feel the pain of the situation, which is an important aspect of processing her emotions about the relationship.",

      "post": "I feel like im falling into a horrible mental state and dont know how to stop it\nLet me start with saying I HATE MY JOB.  Before Power, I was a confident, happy, social, recent college grad. In just 3 months after getting the job I feel like a shell of myself. I am always unhappy, all I want to do is sleep and call out of work. I am starting to shun my support system and literally everything feels overwhelming when before I felt as if I could conquer the world.  My self esteem has not been this low since middle school, I feel like I can do nothing right and honestly the idea of a car crash seems more and more appealing everyday.   I try to stay positive and grateful, but the things I care about are starting to loose their importance. My concentration on anything sucks.   fuck, I would quit this job if I had the energy to look for another one but in a fucked up way this job is also the only thing helping me stay a float.  I dont know why im here, but say whatever you think I need to hear. Or advise me. Or just read this and maybe feel better about your life.",
      "Post Summary": "A dominant maladaptive self-state is evident in the post, particularly when discussing difficulties with the new job. This includes a depressive affect and a sense of hopelessness, followed by neglectful behaviors and thoughts of self-harm. Additionally, a critical self-perception is apparent.\r\n\r\nHowever, a subtle adaptive self-state can be recognized in their attempt to stay positive and express gratitude, suggesting an effort to improve their emotional state. Furthermore, their request for advice indicates relational behavior and a willingness to seek support.",

In the other posts, there is limited information, but the maladaptive voice is less evident, suggesting there may be fluctuations in the writer's state. In posts before and after the one with the maladaptive voice, the writer asks if others want to draw her, which could suggest self-compassion during these moments, indicating adaptive elements in her self-state. Although some information is missing, it\u2019s possible there are fluctuations between posts that aren\u2019t immediately apparent. Due to the lack of enough information within individual posts, it's difficult to draw conclusions."

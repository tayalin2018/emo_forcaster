      "post": "A heart\u2019s a heavy burden.\nI\u2019m at this point in my life currently where I\u2019m somehow stuck between feeling the ache of everything, and not feeling anything at all. I was taught from a young age that the \u201conly\u201d way to cope with all the hurt is to flip the switch and turn it off - and now all the switches and wires feel flipped and intertwined and I can\u2019t make sense of a single damn thing.  It\u2019s hard to talk to people about the mess of emotions I feel, or the jumbled thoughts I have. I know people care about me, at least some of the time, but not enough for me to feel okay with talking about the things that keep me up at night. It\u2019s a really lonely, isolating feeling to have. But god, I wish anyone cared more than the bare minimum. Enough to reach inside my chest and rip the hurt right from the comfortable place it rests, covered up by all the excuses and lies I use just to make it through each day.  There\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened this year, so much I\u2019ve let people get away with because my heart is just a little too big for blame and anger to hold onto. I\u2019m so drained though, and I\u2019m so sick of making myself feel small in hopes I\u2019ll fit into people\u2019s lives. And I\u2019m scared, because it hasn\u2019t gotten any better. I don\u2019t know if it will.  Writing all of this is pretty pointless, but at least if you tell it to the void, the void can\u2019t talk back and tell you to suck it up or stop complaining.",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self state in the post is maladaptive and centers the writer's feeling that she is both sick of making himself feel small in front of others, but also doesnt see it stopping, fearing his relatedness needs will never be fulfilled. it causes him to feel so depressed she is disconnecting from himself and descend to apathy, something she learnt when she was little, that when it hurts you should neglect your feeling and disconnect. she is self critical, pointing how she makes excuses and lies to make it through the day,  and she feels as if its hard to talk about his emotions with others, because she feels uncomfortable sharing with them as they are viewed as detached. The adaptive self state centers his wish for relatedness, for someone to care about him, and she recognizes that some people do care about him, and that she has good qualities too - like a big heart.",

      "post": "Feeling like a waste of space.\nEvery time I go to make a post here I get annoyed with myself because honestly, who fucking cares lol. But I'm just drained and need an outlet to vent so here I am yet again.  I know everyone moves through life at different paces, and not everything is as good as it seems, even for people who are more fortunate than others. Even still, I feel like I'm not where I'm meant to be at all and it's slowly killing me. So many people I know are getting their shit together - getting in happy relationships and starting families, having their own homes, and living their best lives. And I know I shouldn't be so worried about that stuff at 23, but fuck. I've been dealt shitty cards from the start and I'm sick of not having anything good for myself. I'm sick of feeling like a shadow in this world.  On top of that, I'm getting increasingly lonely, and usually I can control this feeling and not let it get to me but we all know the role depression plays in making you feel isolated. It's so hard to make friends though. Every time I open up to  someone, or try to build a connection with them, in the end I'm not good enough and they leave. I've stopped reaching out to people because I'm so sick of that cycle repeating. I don't want to keep opening up my heart to people just for them to crush it.  In conclusion, people suck and so does life.",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self state in the post is maladaptive. it centers the fear that his relatedness needs will not be met, and she will keep on getting hurt because of it. this fear is based in experience, that lead him to believe others are detached as they leave him after a short introduction. it makes him react in a fight or flight way, by fleeing connectedness and not reach out to people anymore. the depressive affect is fueling this whole self state, and makes him very self critical as well - stating she is a waste of space. The adaptive self state in the post centers the desire to become more competent, and not live like a shadow in the world anymore. it gives him the strength to share his needs on the forum, a relating behavior, when she feels drained.",

I try to go to people, try to open up to them, put myself in a vulnerable place and all it ever does is fuck me over and make the hurt of everything that much worse.  I feel sick to my stomach with guilt for feeling this way.

There\u2019s always something wrong, either with me or the timing and circumstances.  My heart feels shattered and I feel beside myself with it all. I don\u2019t see the point anymore. I\u2019m never going to have that life I dreamed of. I never asked for much. I just wanted something good to happen. I wanted to be good enough, deserving enough. But I have nothing and no one.

      "post": "Hitting like a train today.\nWe haven't spoken in several months, and it's not really getting any easier. It comes and goes in waves, and it hits hard when I least expect it. Today I gave that new song \"If The World Was Ending\" a listen and it shattered me on the spot; it's that easy for me to spiral into missing him, and I hate it.  I hate that I still miss him - not even romantically (okay maybe a little), but overall, his friendship and his presence in my life. It's such a shitty feeling to have the door slammed on you, so to speak. I know that closure is a tricky construct, and that sometimes you have to make it for yourself, but I'm really struggling in that regard. I truly feel like this is something I'll carry with me to my grave, and that eats away at me.  This month has been a real struggle overall. This time last year was the last time we were okay, before things completely broke apart. I broke contact and tried reaching out to him a couple of weeks ago, which was stupid of me and I know that, and he made it pretty clear he has no interest in ever speaking again. I know in the end it's for the best, but right now it's miserable and I wish I could turn back time.",

The adaptive self state is composed of emotional pain due to this heartbreak, allowing the writer to learn from this in the future showing self-compassion and a belief in the self to grow from this.",

He was by far the most supportive person in my life for all the months we were together. Not even my best friend comes close to being as sincere and sweet as he was. No one has ever made me feel even a fraction of the way he did.   Any new ideas I had, he encouraged me and gave input. If I was feeling down or sick, he'd stream cartoons for us to watch together until I felt better. He always sent me new songs because he knew I'd be stubborn and play old ones on repeat all day otherwise. He sent the best damn memes and made me laugh more than anyone ever did. And when we called, it was always so comfortable and we'd talk for ages about every little thing. He never complained if I babbled on like an idiot.  This is fucking me up and I can't get past it at all. I don't know what to do. I always just cry it out and then sleep it off, but the cycle repeats and I'm growing weaker.

      "post": "Serious, Seriously: Help\nI have both adhd and anxiety but this post will be mainly about anxiety   So my anxiety is starting to go off the walls with shit now, since me and my small group of friends are on a tight rope because of my shit I do, I\u2019m super stressed and devastated that it\u2019s gotten to this point, I\u2019m ashamed and sad beyond measurement, I am usually open to share my opinion (keep in mind I\u2019m a highly logical straightforward person, but with an open sense of humor, but when stuff gets serious I\u2019m super logical and straightforward to the point that it\u2019s THE way or no way kinda deal) and when I share my opinion all of my friends have drastically different views and often make fun of me and disrespect me for my logical viewpoint (and that I live in a highly democratic state and I\u2019m a bit of a republican but enough politics for now) and since I\u2019m republican I don\u2019t want them to know in case they turn me into a social outcast because they are all super democratic people, my anxiety takes over and it starts with thoughts like \u201cwhat if they know (insert highly secretive secret I\u2019ve been hiding that could ruin my entire reputation in the school and ruin my friendship with all at this school)  My anxiety is making me feel like I\u2019m being used by them like a puppet, stuff and thoughts like \u201cthey only like you because you\u2019re funny and know science and history really well so they can get answers\u201d and now that I think about it, my best friend does seem toxic, now that my perspective is skewed with the negativity, I can\u2019t not see it that way,  he never truly listens to me, everyone talks to me like a child, I\u2019m the class clown so how could I be having any problems in life right? My life is clearly hilarious and nothing could go wrong! I wish that was true, none of my friends understand and I\u2019m not trying to sound like an edgy teen \u201cNo one understands me!\u201d For attention I\u2019m actually serious when I say they do not understand me or maddening struggle just to get up everyday and be alive, not once have they listened to me about it, only one time has one of them listened, it was when I slapped him hard and told him to shut the fuck up and listen, he was rambling about me and shit and I snapped and slapped him cutting him off and told him about how my life is crumbling and he didn\u2019t even try to understand, the only way I got him to listen was assault, I\u2019m beyond disappointed. I can\u2019t do this shit anymore, I\u2019m going to snap soon from this stress and stuff, my friend never shifts his perspective to mine, I\u2019ve told him about my adhd and anxiety and my persistent lack of sleep and how it\u2019s ruining my life and he never listens or tries to understand, he\u2019s ignorant and irritating when I talk serious to him, I cannot fucking stand it, there\u2019s no one to talk to about this serious shit except him and if I do it to anyone else I\u2019ll get sent to a fucking mental institute because they\u2019ll misunderstand and call the fucking cops because of what I told them about what was happening in my fucked up head. I\u2019m not gonna say what goes on in my head because it\u2019s uncomfortable to talk about and I will probably be called a faker and shit like that, most subreddit dwellers are ignorant and selfish (except you lovely fellows and a few other subs, other than those no one will ever look from another POV and are insanely ignorant)  I\u2019m scared that everything is gonna fall apart and before I know it I\u2019m gonna be hanging from my own ceiling from not being able to handle this anymore.  Thank you for reading, I needed to vent, I don\u2019t really need any support in the comments but I don\u2019t mind, I just needed to tell someone even anonymously would work.  If a single one of you criticizes anything in this I want you to think about what damage you\u2019ve caused and how much that may hurt, don\u2019t be ignorant and spread hate, don\u2019t leave hate just leave, spread love and care and avoid things you don\u2019t like, don\u2019t be an idiot",
      "Post Summary": "The main self state in the post is maladaptive and centers the writer's expectation that he will not be able to cope with his situation a lot longer, feeling his competence needs will not be met. it makes him feel very anxious, and coupled with his lack of sleep (sign of self-neglect) and his critical view of himself as the creator of the problems with his friends, and the view of others as detached and unaccepting of his views, he is constantly on edge. this takes him to behave towards others aggressively, in a controlling way, and even hit others so they listen. The adaptive self state is centered around the writer's wish for relatedness exhibited in his cry for help from the forum. the act of sharing follows his need to vent, and is a sign of self-care behavior by the writer. additionally, the writer feels emotional pain following sharing his needs and condition with his best friend, and views himself in a sign of self acceptance as a logical, funny and straightforward person.",

When his anxious affect appears, the dominance of the maladaptive self state is sure to become increasingly dominant. that being said, it's important to know that the maladaptive self states dominated through most of the timeline, with some posts showcasing solely maladaptive self states. towards the end of the timeline, the elements of the self states turned outwards, with cognitions and behavior towards others becoming more dominant."

Additionally, the preparation exhibits self-acceptance regarding the future depressive phase to come. The maladaptive state is indicated by the depressive affect starting to take hold of the writer, following the transition into the depressive episode.",

      "post": "Saved my best friend's life\nAlright so me and her met 4 years ago and I can't possibly explain how much she meant to me and how I literally grew into her personality  But for this year I felt like she was ignoring and estranging herself from me (which broke my heart but also taught me lessons of tough love, but that's a story for another day).   Here's a post I made about it sometime ago:-  https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/e08sd6/formerish_best_friend_distancing_herself_from_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  But yesterday night (she is halfway across the world from me rn), she- she confided in me. She told me about everything that had been bothering her. Her parents are arguing and may divorce each other, her mother hates her and even physically hits her, and her dad won't let her go to college next year if her mom leaves...   All of this, naturally, took a toll on her. You can't imagine the terror I myself felt when she told me all this. I did know about it but that was years ago, and I felt disqualified as a friend to support her in this with her distancing from me and all.   But yesterday night she came clean. And she was suicidal. She threatened me about jumping into the Thames right then. But it was me, who touched her heart. In a world where no one understood us, we understood each other. I saved her life.   And the best part - for a person who puts up a tough act and has deep trust issues - she thanked me. She told me she was grateful to have me. And she'd do the same for me.   She's still my friend. I'm not all alone.   Anyway I just had to tell someone about this, you guys seemed ideal. This has been me, and till next time, peace!",
      "Post Summary": "The main self state in the post is adaptive. It follows the writer's relating behavior exhibited when he saved his friend's life by speaking with her. During this saving, the writer felt what helped was that they understood each other, viewing her as related. The experience and the closeness resulting from it lead him to view himself in a more accepting way, thinking he is not all alone, and to feel proud of himself. following his relatedness needs, he shared the experience online. the maladaptive self state is centered around the cognition of his best friend as detached. This cognition is backed by the friend's detached behavior, and the writer feels heartbroken and lonely because of it. through it all, he still criticizes himself for not asking her sooner about her situation.",

Like if I feel guilty for something I did to someone, my guilt and perception will appear in the form of the person I'm thinking of, staring silently into my soul from the corner of the room. Now this had already happened twice before, but both the times I was calm and looking at them.   Yesterday night I was chatting with my friend about all this and I brought up a person who I shouted really bad at once. The next thing - she only with her head is staring at me from the corner. The head wasn't gorily cut off or anything it was just that I simply didn't focus on the limbs.   I tried to look away. Move. Even text her about this. But I couldn't. And the more I tried, the worse it got.   My eyes were fixated on hers. I was hyper manic throughout the day and it was one of the best days of my life till that point. But then I was having a full on panic attack. My hands and legs were violently shaking. My teeth were clattering. I was really cold yet the blanket was at my legs and I still couldn't pull it.

This leads the writer to feel extremely anxious.

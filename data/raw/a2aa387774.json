      "post": "My partner wants a dog and I have an involuntary response to them\nMy partner of 5 years had two elderly dogs when I first moved in.  They had some serious health problems and our home smelled like dog feces and urine for a good 2 years.  During that time I developed a deep repulsion to dog smell.  To me the fur, breath and feces all smell the same: revolting.  I actually am embarrassed to even touch a friendly looking dog for fear that when I smell my hands or the dog after, the wretching begins. It's like an involuntary dry heave.  My partner doesn't understand and deeply wants a dog and our therapist suggested therapy to see if I could get over this issue before writing off the idea of no dog forever.  Is this something a hypnotherapist can work on? Smell triggers and smell associations?",
      "Post Summary": "both self states are pretty evenly present in the post. the maladaptive self state is composed of an expectation that the writer's autonomy needs will not be met and she will be forced to take a dog although she is disgusted by them. this expectation is coupled with her view of her partner as detached and not understanding of her needs regarding this matter. the adaptive self state is centered around a desire for help from others, taking her to seek advice from others on the forum, and from a couples therapist.",

      "post": "My partner of 5 years wants a dog.\nWhen I first moved in he had 2 elderly mini poodles that were poorly trained but also suffered health ailments and our house continually smelled like dog urine and feces.   Eventually they passed from old age a year ago.  He wants another dog but I simply cannot deal with dog smell since living with them.  I will see a cute friendly dog and go to pet them but the slightest dog smell makes me dry heave.  Fur, dog breath, poop, it all smells the same revolting smell to me now.  I even stayed with my brother who had a dog and the few times I pet it, when I smelled the dog on my hands or in the house I had uncontrollable dry heaves.  We have met with a couples counsellor and my partner seems to think I am exaggerating but the counsellor suggested I may have to try something like hypnotherapy since it is now an involuntary reaction.   I am scared of hypnosis but feel he has given me an ultimatum.   We get a dog or I go.  He is 40 and I am 38 and we have a 3yo.  What to do??",

      "post": "My mom sued me and my baby had cancer\nIn the last 12 months I have really been a tough go of things.  Almost exactly 1 year ago I was served legal papers by my estranged mother.  She was suing me over a small inheritance my father left me 10 years ago.   Then a couple weeks later I found out I was pregnant.  My partner of 4 years and father to our 2 yo told me he wanted me to get an abortion and move out.   He carried a genetic mutation so I decided like with my son, to get genetic testing by way of CVS at 11 weeks.  We found out that the baby would be born with retinoblastoma.  I was devastated but didn't know what to do.   Would I raise the baby as a single mom? My partners mom was born with retinoblastoma and went blind.  She went on to have 4 children with it and 2 of them died in their 20s and early 30s from complications of it.   At 22 weeks I had a termination which was on my birthday.   It was horrible and I am haunted by it every day.  When he found out the baby girl had cancer he said he wanted to now keep it but by then the trust was broken.  I felt so upset that my fiance and father to my child would kick me out pregnant and want to abort.  But then magically change his mind.  I would have had to deliver early by 4 weeks and the baby would have undergone daily cancer treatments in a different city for 3 months.  I was very overwhelmed with not knowing what to do.  Plus onto of that my estranged mother sued me.  It ended up costing me $40 000 in legal fees but I sat in court on the witness stand and provided testimony.  It was so hard.  She had abused me my entire life and it wasnt until I had my son that I realized I didn't want her near him and had to cut her out.  She was so mad she did everything she could to punish me.  Including suing me.  I was so scared.  But in the end I won.  I stood up against her and she lost the lawsuit.   But now it's been a year and I was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and derealization (which I have had for 15 years due to being around my abusive mother).   Tomorrow I start EMDR therapy and CBT course for 8 weeks.  Then I start my DBT program for 32 weeks. I am still with my partner but I am so scared to leave him  I love him even though he doesnt seem to treat me right.  I have no family anymore other than my son and I am really struggling.  I feel like I have lost everything really except my son but really, I see myself turning into my mother anyway and that scares me.  I want a better mother for him but I am not a strong person with no support.  Every day I regret my decision to terminate but I thought I could not do it alone.  I feel so scared to do anything.  If I am honest, I really just want to die.  I want to lie down and never wake up.   I just can't live with this pain",
      "Post Summary": "The main self in the post is maladaptive  and centers the expectation that the writer will not be able to cope with everything going on, her competence needs not met, as everything feels incredibly overwhelming to her, making her feel  incredibly anxious. this expectation has roots in reality, as her mother used to abuse her, thus she is viewed as detached, and tried to control her impairing her autonomy. this all leads her to view herself as an incapable, weak person. The adaptive self state is centered around wanting to a better life for her son. it gives her the motivation to care for herself, going to therapy, and to act autonomously  by going to court and defending her case against her mother. she is also trying to keep her small family together for him, saying she loves his father (showing relatability).",

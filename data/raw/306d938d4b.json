      "post": "Vac700 finally costs me some clothing.\nLast week, the blind cap became stuck, and removed the piston rod entirely when I unscrewed it to fill the pen. I gently got it loose, lubricated the threads with silicone, and it worked well for a week.   Today, on going to draw back the piston to clear the pen for cleaning, it did the same and sent a load of Noodler's Black all over my pants. I think the piston rod and blind cap need replaced. If it sticks once, okay. Twice and a pair of shorts?  I've emailed TWSBI to ask about replacement parts. We'll see.",

      "post": "NHL13 appears to be basically dead, I've heard good things about 14, bad about 15. Should I wait for 16 or go with 14?\nI play the wheels off of the NHL series when I get them- I went from NHL10 to 13 after getting the Leafs 3 straight Cup wins, just to prove I could. Got about 200 hours in it at this point.  I've had 13 since pre-order, but have just started to mess around with HUT after a couple Detroit Cup runs. Hence, I'm starting late.  Is the trade pool basically dead? I've been putting up stuff at fire sale prices- 6-10 game contracts for 100 pucks and barely getting any nibbles, and my team sucks. I simply can't rack up enough pucks to get a gold pack and start to improve.  I'm looking at 14, but I fear the trading is just as dead. I've heard they broke a lot of things in 15 (at least there was a lot of complaining on Twitter), so I don't know if that's worth it.  Should I hold on for 16, and go 10-13-16, or is 14 alive enough to be worthwhile?",

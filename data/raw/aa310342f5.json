      "post": "DAE feel like their ability to cry has been completely broken?\nI used to be the type of person who cried all the time. I would burst into tears whenever anything upset me, if I was overwhelmed, if I was hurting and various other reasons.   Over the years I had my parents, friends and SO\u2019s all tell me I had no reason to cry. I would sometimes be gaslighted into thinking that my feelings weren\u2019t valid and I was being \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201ctoo emotional\u201d or \u201cplaying victim\u201d. I had an ex tell me I looked ugly when I cried and look me dead in the face and tell me that crying wouldn\u2019t do anything repeatedly. Something that echoed in my mind as it was something my parents said all the time except they would pair it with \u201cI\u2019ll give you something to cry about\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what changed in me but I just.. stopped. I stopped crying altogether. It\u2019s very hard for me to cry and on the off chance that I do, I don\u2019t like to be seen by others. Which sometimes hurts me in the long term because crying is healthy and a good way to release emotion. I sometimes try to force myself to cry by listening to sad music, reading sad stuff or watching sad shows and nothing.   DAE find their ability to cry has been broken?",
      "Post Summary": "The post reveals two distinct self-states. The first is characterized by a blunted affect, evident in the writer's mention of being unable to cry or feeling that their ability to cry is \"broken.\" This detachment is also noticeable in how they reflect on others' past treatment of them while crying. Additionally, there is a hint of self-criticism and possibly shame, as they express discomfort with being seen by others.\r\n\r\nThe second self-state centers on a desire for connection and relatedness. The writer seeks out people who share similar feelings and engages in self-care behaviors, such as attempting to cry, as a way to release emotions they recognize as being present within them.",

He said he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship. Which I understood and tried to stay but I couldn\u2019t handle the hot and cold or the one sided effort anymore.   I seen him on tinder and I was about to get in my feels after weeks of feeling fine because I hadn\u2019t been forced to see his face. Then I caught myself and went no. This isn\u2019t how things go. I was there for him on his darkest days, I would come and make him smile when he thought he couldn\u2019t anymore. I made him feel safe enough to show me his demons and open up to me in ways he couldn\u2019t with anyone else. I cheered with him when he succeeded. I was a great force in his life, he would call me his safe space.   I\u2019m a one of a kind person. I fought through hell and back to get to where I am. Choosing to be loving and kind when I wanted nothing but to be cold and cruel. The type of person who makes you laugh when you want to cry but offers a shoulder when you need one. I can guarantee he won\u2019t find another me because we as humans are unique individuals. There\u2019s only one me.

      "post": "I[24] am having issues with ex/baby dad[23M] who continually love bombs me, creates issues and is sleeping with and dating a freshly [18F]\nI \\[24F\\] was with my ex/baby dad Ricky\\[23M\\] for four and a half years. We have a toddler together that we share 50/50. I ended the relationship because over the years after the honeymoon phase ended, he was very cruel to me at times (example: would look me in the face and say he didn't love me and tell me I had no reason try cry when I did), would turn things around on me (example: would offer to hold my credit card so I wouldn't lose it and then tell me \"Well you should carry your own stuff then\" when I was upset he lost it.), had me work to support our family while he played video games and smoked weed with his friends all day, constantly accused me of cheating and had gotten verbally and physically aggressive with not only myself but my friends. (Threw me out of a cab, pushed my best friend twice and purposly burnt her with a ciggarette because she's a lesbian and he was convince we were sleeping together.) It seemed like Ricky was starting to turn around and be better man near the end but it wouldn't last more than a few weeks and I was so mentally drained from the relationship. Everytime I forgave him, I lost more feelings. I had a hard time looking at him the same after he physically assaulted me and my best friend. I left him around 8 months ago.  I started to see a guy Tony\\[24M\\] casually a few months ago and when Ricky found out, he told everyone i was seeing a \"pedophile rapist\" which wasn't true. He told me that I was a \"slimy whore\" and probably had STI's. I avoided my ex as much as I could as I couldn't handle the verbal abuse. Tony and I ended things because I realized I wasn't mentally ready for a relationship after my last one.  Two weeks ago, Ricky and I got into a disagreement because our toddler is still sleeping in a playpen and does not have his own space because Ricky still lives with his mother. We also fought about him leaving our toddler with his mother at all times to hangout with friends. I told him that if he didn't start being a more active parent that I would want to keep my child the 10 days he's working and he can have him the 4 days he's off to spend proper time with him. He stated that he would get his own place and wanted to stay 50/50. When we were speaking about these issues, he kept telling me that he was still in love with me and there was no one he wanted but me. He kept trying to touch me so I got really uncomfortable and told him to stop. I blocked him on everything to get some space.  Recently I realized that our toddler was showing signs of autism so I unblocked Ricky on everything to let him know my concern and let him know when the appointment was so he could attend and we could make up a action plan for our child. Ricky started off with all the things he usually say like \"everyone was ugly compared to me\", \"you have my heart\" and all this other stuff. He also stated that he started sleeping with and seeing Nikki who  was 18 and he liked her but she was \"nothing compared to me\" and he wants me back.  I told him I wasn't interested in getting back together and was horrified by this and the fact he was going on 3 day benders and partying with barely legal girls.  When I told my friend about Nikki, she had her 16 year old brother tell her that this girl was 17 years old. I was went to him about this and he panicked and told me that she was 18. I am not proud of rhis but I absolutely lost my noodle. He went to Nikki and she sent him a picture of her id and he sent it to me to show she was 18. However she JUST turned 18 a month ago. He said that he was mad at me because I probably made it so this girl won't talk to him ever again. He is jumping back and forth between getting mad at me and calling me crazy to hitting on me and saying he loves me. He says are \"equal now\" because I slept with a \"pedophile rapist\" (which reminder, isn't true) so it's okay for him to sleep with a 18 year old.  I feel disgusted and unsure of how to navigate parenting or having a co-parentship with Ricky. While it is not my business who he sleeps with or what he does, it worries me because he is setting a bad example for our child. Technically it is legal for him to see the 18 year old but I feel disgusted. What does a 23 year old have in common with a 18 year old? At 18 you are just starting to experience life and the world. Looking back I realize how weird and almost predatory it was to have guys that age hitting on me when I was so young. I don't want to be with this man but I found myself having a breakdown with all the things that happened in the past few months.   What would be the best course of action to deal with all of this?  (TLDR: I \\[24F\\] dated Ricky \\[23M\\] for 4 and a half years. We have a toddler together. I left him because he was abusive in a multitude of ways. I started seeing Toni \\[24M\\] and Ricky went off about how Tony was a \"pedophile rapist\" which wasn't true so I avoided Ricky. Toni and I ended because I wasn't mentally ready for a relationship. Two weeks ago I met with Ricky to discuss some issues I had with him (my toddler sleeping in a playpen at his house, not having his own space and Ricky leaving our son to hangout with friends a lot) and he kept telling me that he loved me and all girls were ugly except me. He kept trying to kiss and touch me which made me uncomfortable and I told him that and then blocked him. Recently I found out my toddler may have autism and booked an appointment to start the process of getting him tested and I felt it was important for Ricky to be involved. Ricky started his same old \"I love you\" speel and stated he was seeing a 18 year old Nikki. I confided in my friend about Nikki and her 16 year old brother told us that Nikki was 17 years old. I am embarassed to say I lost my noodle and Ricky went to Nikki and asked for a picture of her id. Which he sent to me, Nikki JUST turned 18. He got mad at me for \"ruining\" his relationship with Nikki. He stated we are \"even\" because me sleeping with a \"pedophile rapist\" is equal to sleeping with a 18 year old. However after getting mad, Ricky is flip flopping between telling me he loves me and wants to be back together to being mad I \"ruined his relationship\" with Nikki It is not my business and is technically legal but I feel it is morally wrong and almost predatory for him to be seeing a 18 year old. I also feel that Ricky partying with barely legal girls and going on benders will set a bad example for our child. What would be the best course of action to deal with all of this? How do I manage a co-parentship without the drama?)",

That you are mature for your age to have a 23 year old man wine and dining you. He will tell you how me and his girlfriend before were. Leaving out all the abuse for both of us. He will make us seem like crazy girls and never mention his actions that lead to strong reactions. Once you fall in love, he will stop giving you love. He will tell you he doesn\u2019t know how to love. He will look you in the eyes and tell you he doesn\u2019t love you and when you cry, he will tell you have no reason to cry. He will accuse you of cheating. When he is drunk, he will be cruel and verbally abusive. If the fights get really bad while he\u2019s drunk, he has a history of pushing your friends and throwing you out of a cab or burning someone with a cigarette.

When I see him in person, we have to be in public or he tries to touch me.  Telling me he loves me and wishes he could be with me.  He is a manipulative man who only cares about himself.

Dressed like a bum. Never helped with our child or supported us financially. None of it.  But after I left, he suddenly is working a bunch. Gets haircuts and upkeeps his facial hair. Wears cologne.

This state is accompanied by a sense of pride and an expectation that her competence needs are being met, viewing her response as a significant step forward in distress tolerance. Additionally, there is a potential, though uncertain, element of prosocial behavior, reflected in wishing her friend well. While this intention is explicit, there is some ambiguity regarding its accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe second self-state revolves around self-criticism, focusing on past behavior characterized by having a complete emotional meltdown. This state is marked by a blunt affect, with minimal grieving or sadness over the loss of a significant friendship. Instead, the perception of the friend appears detached, particularly in response to her action of blocking the user's number.",

      "post": "When I was in the intensive care unit at the hospital for an almost fatal suicide attempt, incoherently calling for my partner.. he was out partying.\nI left this relationship a long time ago and in a lot of ways I have healed and moved on but this.. this is something that scars me to this day.  After a real nasty fight while we were drunk, I tried to kill myself. I was released the next day and in my drugged out state I attempted a second time. This time more serious and I accidentally sent him a voice memo of my mom walking in and shouting and my spaced out voice saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here anymore.\u201d He heard this and was told by my mother that I was in the hospital. He was told that I was having grand maul seizures. He decided it was in his best interest to go out partying instead of making sure that I was okay.   I lost several days of memory. I have no idea what happened those days. I was told by those who were around me and have minor little pieces of memory near the end when I started to become more coherent. I also found the voice memo I accidentally sent. It scares me to this day that I will never know. My mother and grandmother told me that I wouldn\u2019t talk but when I did, I would ask where he was and cry. I would also try to escape and fight hospital staff to find him. No matter how badly he treated me, he was all I thought about.  That\u2019s what truly breaks my heart, my blind love and devotion to a man that broke me. Who was out partying instead of being there for me and said: \u201cWell it\u2019s not like I could have seen you in the hospital anyways.\u201d Or tried to deny that he knew about it. He also tried to say that he tried to take me to the party? Lies on top of lies on top of lies. He partied the whole time I was in the hospital.  There was so much wrong with that relationship. I didn\u2019t try to use my suicide attempt to manipulate him or make him feel bad. After experiencing so much abuse in the relationship for a long period of time, having a undiagnosed mental disorder and harbouring a lot of childhood trauma.. I just snapped and tried to end my life. I was already shakey with my mental health and to have someone gaslight, invalidate me and lie to me every day took its toll. Having him look me dead in the face and tell me he didn\u2019t love me just to make me cry and tell me I was a ugly crier or I had no reason to cry. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. I don\u2019t blame him for my attempt. It was just another factor in a long list of problems.   I didn\u2019t expect anything but to be loved at my darkest hour. Like I loved him. And he wasn\u2019t there for me and it still breaks my heart to this day. I felt so abandoned, lost and alone. When I told him my feelings, he told me I was trying to use my suicide as a manipulative tactic or made me out to be this awful person who tried to ruin his life.   I wish I could say I walked away after that but I didn\u2019t and I deeply regret that. But now? Now I am free. I\u2019m properly medicated. I am in therapy. I am confident in myself and my body again. There is always hope after a bad relationship.",
      "Post Summary": "The dominant self-state in this post is characterized by self-compassion, culminating in the conclusion that she now feels free. This is further supported by self-care behaviors, such as staying properly medicated and attending therapy. Together, these reflect her acknowledgment of a complex but improving sense of self. She feels hopeful and demonstrates a belief that competence and resilience can be achieved, even during very challenging times.\r\n\r\nThe other evident self-state focuses on her perception of others, particularly her ex, as detached. She recalls feeling invalidated by him during critical moments, such as her time in the hospital or when her mental health was fragile. The affect associated with these situations is one of yearning for love and care that she did not receive. Additionally, self-harm behaviors are implied, though not explicitly tied to the same self-state.",

      "post": "My progress in being less reactive (Losing friend but not my mind)\nA week or so ago, I lost a friend. I made the poor decision of having sex with my ex (who physically abused her and I one night a year ago) so she decided she didn\u2019t want to be my friend anymore. She took me off everything without saying a word.   Normally I would have lost my absolute mind. I would have messaged her and demanded to know why she took me off social media. I would have sat and argued with her over her decision and why it wasn\u2019t unfair. I would have tried to justify my poor decision.  Except I didn\u2019t.  I just respected her decision and didn\u2019t fight it. I didn\u2019t get upset. I didn\u2019t do anything. I could have argued that her being best friends with my abuser means my action was okay. However one thing does not cancel out another. Clearly my decision hurt her and I accept the consequences of that decision. Sleeping with my ex and encouraging his bad behaviour is absolutely wrong in every word of a sense and I make no excuses. The price of shameless sex was the loss of a friend and it\u2019s something I will have to deal with and learn from.   I got an really long, verbally abusive text message from my abuser she\u2019s friends with. It was made clear to me that my now ex friend had told her intimate details about my life. However my abuser took mere grains of truth and twisted it to be unrecognizable.   Normally I would have fed into the drama with my abuser.  I would have confronted my now ex friend for giving my abuser information about me. Demanded to know why she would betray me like this. Start a fight. Raise hell.  Instead I firmly told my abuser to leave me alone. I confronted my ex friend about giving my phone number to my abuser and she denied it. She admitted to giving the abuser info about my child but not the rest of it. I apologized for accusing her of giving my abuser my number and told her there were no hard feelings, I respected her decision and just wanted my stuff back. We exchanged things and that was the end of that. I felt hurt that she spilled some beans but I feel no animosity or hatred.   These don\u2019t seem like a big deal but it\u2019s a huge step forward for me in being less reactive and being more in control with myself and my emotions. It\u2019s a huge step forward to coming to terms with the consequences of my bad decisions. I\u2019m actually accepting things for what they are and learning from them.  I got this.",

Additionally, her behavior toward others is characterized by forgiveness and understanding of their actions, with an affect of sadness but no hatred.\r\n\r\nThe other self-state expressed in the post involves self-criticism, particularly when she mentions sleeping with her ex, which she perceives as a poor decision. This state is accompanied by a blunted affect, possibly as a defense mechanism against difficult thoughts.

      "post": "My ex/baby daddy[23M] told me that he is officially dating a [18F]\nThe last time he told me that he slept with a girl who was freshly 18, I lost my mind. I told him how gross and inappropriate it was. I went into a full BPD meltdown when I heard she was actually 17 and it turned into a big shit show where she ended up sending a picture of her Id and telling him that she didn\u2019t need the drama in her life.   This time he told me that he is dating a 18 year old. He said that he has been seeing her for 2 weeks but they are 2 days officially dating. (Which is funny because he tried to tell me he loved me like 2 weeks ago and was hitting on me a week ago.)   I simply congratulated him and told him that I hope that he\u2019s happy. Asked that he waits a long time before he introduces her to our child or me. Left it at that.   I don\u2019t find the relationship appropriate at all. However when he told me this, he was dressed like he was 18 himself. Giant stud diamond earrings. Cap turned back. Large wooden rosary with a cross. Just the whole outfit was like a frat boy. He\u2019s been partying everyday and neglecting his duties as a father. He\u2019s simply not ready to grow up so him dating a 18 year old would match his maturity level.   All of these things would normally have sent me into an episode but I have finally reached a place where I accept everything for what it is. Freaking out or making a scene doesn\u2019t do anything but make me look stupid. It doesn\u2019t change the fact he\u2019s dating a 18 year old. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to magically grow up. It just shows how right I was to leave.

This includes asserting control over certain aspects while letting go of others beyond her control.\r\n\r\nThe other self-state involves perceiving her ex as weak, out of control, and unfair in fulfilling his responsibilities as a father. Additionally, there is an underlying sense of fear and self-criticism regarding how she reacted in the past.",

      "post": "My Nex decided that it was appropriate to verbally abuse me and announce his new relationship with his new supply the same day I find out my there\u2019s high chances my grandmother will die soon.\nMy Nex and I got into an argument this past weekend after I kept trying to get a hold of him for days to discuss our schedules to get our son\u2019s daycare figured out. I said some poor things about his new supply in the heat of the moment which I felt a lot of remorse for. He didn\u2019t care in the slightest but demanded I apologize to her. I already planned on apologizing beforehand and sent something heartfelt. In the apology I mentioned that I understood how it felt because my Nex insulted a guy I was with so it wasn\u2019t fair to her. (Remember this for later)   Today I found out my grandmother will be forced to have a surgery where the survival rate is 40% ane if she does survives there could be plenty of complications. There\u2019s also a 60% she will die during surgery or become a vegetable. I told my groupchat mediated by his mother about it and that I might need support as I deal with it. My Nex decided to call me and coldly said: \u201cSorry to hear about your grandma\u201d and you could hear him go to talk then hang up abruptly because I was crying.   He then texted me saying how dare I tell his new supply he was viscous towards a guy I had been seeing. He didn\u2019t call to talk about my grandma, he called to get at me. He told me it\u2019s okay for him to insult people I see because they are \u201cfacts\u201d (he called the guy I had been seeing a pedo rapist) and it\u2019s completely different then me insulting his new supply.  He never apologized to that poor guy either. He told me I was gross and fucked for \u201cfucking a jailed rapist\u201d, stupid and many other things. I asked him to have some empathy (foolish, I know) as he was supposedly hurt when he lost his grandma and he told me that it\u2019s completely different and not to bring it up. He said his new supply was having a bad day and blocked my number. I had to get his mother to speak to him so I would be unblocked so I can call in case of emergencies (like our son being hurt) or the small occasions we have to talk to co-parent.   Not long after he decided to show his new relationship off to the world like a prized penny.  Completely remorseless for tearing me to shreds or how I was feeling. To further sweeten the blow, he hasn\u2019t spent a single minute with his son. He spends it with his new supply or partying.  I wish I never dated him, he has always been my worst nightmare.",

She expresses a depressed mood regarding her situation with her ex and her grandmother's medical condition and appears to be seeking empathy.\r\n\r\nA more subtle self-state involves seeking help and engaging in self-care behaviors, though she seems to be looking for support in the wrong places.

When she is able to perceive herself as capable and confident, her behavior and self-state tend to be more adaptive. However, this is often accompanied by a polarized affect, where sadness\u2014an adaptive emotion\u2014coexists with a blunted affect, which is maladaptive and may indicate a defense mechanism. There are frequent transitions between these states, with the maladaptive voice often being dominant, while the adaptive voice remains more subtle and in need of further adjustment."

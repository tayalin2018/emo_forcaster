Declawing is awful\nReading about how awful declawing is for your cat is heartbreaking and it blows my mind that these vets who claim they love animals would do something like this just because someone decides to get a cat and not want their furniture scratched. Easy solution - get your cats nails trimmed regularly and you can even buy nail caps for your cats. Trying to find a place for a spay clinic to spay for my kitten who was found in a parking lot and so many of these clinics support declawing it\u2019s so awful.

He does so much for her- he constantly cooks for her - every meal too. He brings her coffee in bed each day. He will run her errands for take her car to get washed, will do her laundry for her, buys her flowers, takes her on vacations like Hawaii several times in a year and other things and so much more and she rarely says thank you or even nods a bit of appreciation for him.

She endlessly complains about his dog. She complains about his family and friends but then has no problem hanging with them when they are around.

      "post": "Am I over reacting? Is it stupid for me to be upset or is it okay for me to be a little upset at my aunt.\n3 years ago my great grandma ( my aunts grandma ) died. Ever since she died I\u2019ve wanted a memorial tattoo for her because we were so close. Talked to each other on the phone twice a week, I went multiple times to see her and didn\u2019t go on other vacations because I wanted to spend time with my grandma. I remember her birthday, sent birthday and Christmas gifts. I sent other little gifts just because and she did the same for me ( of course I never expected gifts in return ) . We were so close. I booked a flight for a Wednesday afternoon to say my final goodbyes and she died Monday so I was two days to late and it tore me to pieces. Anyway I have a birthday card I found the day before my birthday the year she died- it was the perfect angel sign. On it said \u201c All my love, gram ( and then my grandmas name ) so ever since then I\u2019ve decided I wanted that tattooed I just haven\u2019t gotten it yet because I haven\u2019t found someone where I live and I can\u2019t decide between ankle or wrist. My aunt asked me a while back for my grandmas name in writing because she had really pretty curly cursive writing so I sent her one from a book I had that just said \u201cLove, Grandma ( and then grandmas name ) well earlier this week she text me asking for the photo again. I recently moved so I no longer had that photo but just had a photo of the \u201cAll my love \u201c quote I wanted so I cropped it to just the Gram and my grandmas name. She immediately messaged back asking if it said Love, or anything so I told her what it said without sending a photo and explained how that was what I was getting tattooed on me but I could send her a picture of the whole card and she could piece together Love, Grandma. She replies back she wants the \u201call my love \u201c portion too for her tattoo now. I\u2019m irritated because I just told her I wanted that for my tattoo, it has extremely special meaning to me, and to top it all off my aunt constantly acts like she was the best granddaughter to my grandma but when my grandma was still alive she used to always complain the only time my aunt called was when she wanted something , she rarely came and visited her. My cousins all say the same thing about my aunt so it just irks me that right after I mention I am getting it tattooed she ask for the same piece for her tattoo. Part of me wants to tell her to just find her own card that has my grandmas writing. My aunt only seems to text me when she wants something and I know when I was younger she used to make fun of me. I realize now today all this time she acted close to me was always for some benefit for her. Maybe I\u2019m over reacting",
      "Post Summary": "This post reflects two distinct self-states:\r\n\r\nAdaptive Self-State: This is characterized by a desire for validation and connection from others regarding her feelings about the situation with her aunt. She perceives her grandmother as supportive and caring, and her passing evokes feelings of sadness and grief. Additionally, she behaved in a connected and relational way toward her grandmother by talking to her on the phone and visiting her during vacations.\r\n\r\nMaladaptive Self-State: This revolves around her perception of the aunt as punitive and unfair, both in childhood\u2014when the aunt mocked her\u2014and in the present, for taking her tattoo idea. These actions trigger anger in the writer, but she also expresses concern that she might be overreacting. This suggests an effort to protect herself from the possibility that others may not empathize with her situation.",

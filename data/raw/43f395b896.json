      "post": "What are you supposed to do if you find a car broken into?\nMy city has a huge problem with auto theft, burglary, and vandalism. Like, you pretty much can't own a car here without it being broken into at some point. Today I noticed a car in my apartment complex's parking lot with the window shattered, the door open, and some stuff on the ground. I felt so bad and wanted to do something, but I'm not sure if there's anything I could have done. I had no way to contact the owner and didn't want to risk implicating myself in any way so I just left it alone. Is that what you're supposed to do? Really sucks for whoever that happened to. \ud83d\ude15",
      "Post Summary": "This post reflects two self-states:\r\n\r\nAn adaptive self-state characterized by empathetic and justifiable anger about witnessing the car break-in. This state also includes relational behavior, as the writer seeks to understand what could have been done in the situation.\r\n\r\nA maladaptive self-state centered on the expectation that nothing could have been done and a subtle fear of getting into trouble if they had tried to help. This state also includes a perception of others as detached, reflected in the writer's remarks about the city\u2019s broader problems and the potential consequences of intervening.",

I don't even want to talk to people I don't know because I don't want anyone getting the wrong idea.",
      "Post Summary": "The adaptive self-state is subtle but can be observed in the mention of being an introvert and seeking acknowledgment in the post about their feelings in the situation. This may also indicate a level of self-acceptance regarding certain traits.\r\n\r\nThe maladaptive self-state is reflected in the expectation of not being understood by others, which contributes to anxiety in social situations. This is accompanied by elements of self-criticism.",
